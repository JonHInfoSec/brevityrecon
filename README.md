# [FORKED] Brevity In Motion - Automated Cloud Recon Ecosystem

## Introduction
This is a "forked" version of the brevityrecon repo.

There is detailed information surrounding this repository at: https://www.brevityinmotion.com/automated-cloud-based-recon/

Not all of the codified infrastructure is complete and will be added to this repository in the future as a usable deployment package. There are some dependencies missing like IAM roles and S3 buckets that would need to be implemented for the code to run without error.
